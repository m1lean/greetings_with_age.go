# Greetings With Age | Go

An application that asks the user for their name and age, and then displays a greeting message with age information.


## Features

- This code uses the fmt, bufio and os packages for input and output. The program prompts for the user's name and age, then displays a greeting message indicating the age. Note that the code handles an error when it tries to convert the entered age to a number.
## Installation

You can run this code by saving it to a file with a .go extension, such as main.go, and run the command:

```bash
  go run main.go
```

- Then follow the prompts in the console to enter your name and age and see your greeting.
